# DSW Deployment Example

This is an example deployment of the [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org) using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). You can clone the repository and run it with:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

We recommend reading the [Installation](https://docs.ds-wizard.org/en/latest/admin/installation.html) and [Configuration](https://docs.ds-wizard.org/en/latest/admin/configuration.html) chapters in the documentation. After starting the DSW, you can log in using [Default User Accounts](https://docs.ds-wizard.org/en/latest/admin/installation.html#default-users). The fresh installation does not contain any knowledge model, you can read about how to get the [Initial Knowledge Model](https://docs.ds-wizard.org/en/latest/admin/installation.html#initial-knowledge-model).
